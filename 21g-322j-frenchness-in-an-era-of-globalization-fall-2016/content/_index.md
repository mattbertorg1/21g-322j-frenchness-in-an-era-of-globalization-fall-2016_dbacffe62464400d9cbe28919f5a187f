This course approaches the question of what constitutes Frenchness in today's era of globalization through issues of memory, belonging, and cultural production. It explores the role of timeless traditions – common technologies, an internationally-spoken language, monuments open to the world, and foods such as wine and cheese – that remain quintessentially French. The course also covers recent scandals about France's role in the world, such as its colonial identity and Dominique Strauss-Kahn's New York debacle.

Taught in French.
